simple little bit of node that show some use for background communcations across
the network.

overall it really doesn't do much.

start it with 'node whirleygig.js'

then is a second shell 'node client.js'

then open your browser to http://localhost:8992/test.html

additionally you can telnet localhost 8000   and send a line like this:

[{"text":"data to see on the page"},{"text":"more data"}]
